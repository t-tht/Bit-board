# Product Design Specification (PDS)
The PDS describes requirements that bit:board ought to meet to satisfy the problem statement.

#### Performance
bit:board is expected to bring an educational impact (especially in computer science) to the user.

It has to be a keyboard that includes touch sensors and utilises the Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) functionality and

As our target audience is children aged 11-12, user interface should be easy-to-use.

#### Environment
During transport, storage and usage, bit:board should be able to withstand moderate impact and  normal conditions such as average humidity and temperature.

#### Life in Service
bit:board aims for a long life span(i.e. 2 years), working for 1-2 hours a day.

Materials chosen should be robust for long usage.

#### Maintenance
No professional maintenance required as all components would be hidden from the user for safety reason.

Common maintenance includes change of batteries and cleaning of surface of touch sensors for better sensitivity.

#### Target Product Cost
Aims to have the retail price to be lower than the BBC micro:bit (~£17). Hence, for mass production, PCB would be designed to include touch sensors on board to lower cost for components.

#### Competition
There is no similar products in the market at the moment - no accessories so far makes use of BLE and includes a canvas as controller.

There are micro:bit accessories that functions as game controllers such as :GAME ZIP64 and bit:commander.

In addition, micro:bit accessory that includes touch sensors is touch:bit.

#### Shipping
bit:board is likely to be in batch production. Since it will be manufactured and distributed in the UK, local carriers can be used to send bit:boards from manufacturer to distributor. Shipping of bit:board to international users would be done by distributor.

#### Packaging
An outer housing to pack the bit:board will be required when in transportation.

#### Quantity
Generally, the production volume will be in small incremental steps. To test the water, an initial volume of 200 units will be produced. If the launch of bit:board is successful, then batch volume should be increased by 100 units at each milestone.

#### Manufacturing Facility
For mass production, PCB is likely to be printed by an external manufacturer, meaning that manufacture of PCBs would be outsourced.

For the outer layers of bit:board, a laser cutter is needed. If the cost of production for laser cutting is desirable, then it is likely to be outsourced as well.

#### Customer
Target audience of bit:board is children aged 11-12. Parents are also potential customers as bit:board encourages interactions between parents and children, teacher and students.

#### Size
Should be smaller or equal to A4 size (i.e. 21.0 x 29.7cm) to be able to fit inside a typical school bag

#### Weight
Should be lightweight to reduce the pressure on the user when carrying bit:board around. Yet, bit:board does not need to be lifted up during usage, so being weight-efficient would not be a concern.

#### Materials
To reduce the impact on the environment, bit:board's outer layer would be made from wood (i.e. birch plywood 3mm).

Electrical components such as 4 touch sensors, a joystick, 4 IC switches, 4 LEDs, edge connector and wires would be needed.

Adhesives are also needed to put wood pieces together.

#### Product Life Span
bit:board would be in the market for around a year, and a new improved version would be developed in the mean time.

#### Aesthetics, Appearance and Finish
Since bit:board is made from birch plywood, bit:board would make use of the natural wood pattern, smoothed out using sandpaper of 300-400 grit, finished by applying a layer of Beeswax for aesthetic.

#### Ergonomics
bit:board is designed to be used while sitting on a surface.

There should be no sharp edges or corner and should be smooth to touch.

The inputs should be placed at suitable distance from each other, so they are not too far or too near to each other.

#### Standards and Specification
If bit:board is released to the European micro:bit accessories market, then it must obtain the CE mark and the BSI Kitemark.

#### Quality and Reliability
**Mean time before repair**: depends on the battery life

**Mean time before failure**: since electrical wiring and components are enclosed, with the robust design of bit:board, it should be able to last as long as the life expectancy before any failure

#### Shelf Life(storage)
bit:board should be stored in a cool,dry place to prevent any issue rising from the electronic components

#### Testing
BLE should be tested before being released to the market

#### Processes
- Laser cutting of the wooden case

- Creation of MakeCode package

- Circuit Design

#### Time Scale
Idea generation from meeting with client - Summer term week 0-1
Product, leaflet and poster design - Summer term week 2-6
Hackbooth demonstration - Summer term week 7
Documentation - Summer term week 8-9

#### Safety
**Legal guidelines**
To make bit:board available on the market, all parameters must abide to the EU safety regulations

**Manufacturing Hazards**
Wiring must not be exposed, and multimeter should be used to check if electrically safe

**Operational Hazards**
Rough use and violent treatment of product should be avoided even though robustness is taken into account in product design

#### Company Constraints
We are limited to £500 budget.

Third-party suppliers must be approved by Imperial College London.

#### Market Constraints
Market constraints are difficult to estimate as there is not much data on the micro:bit accessories market. Moreover, there are no similar implementation in the market, so there are no references to take from.

#### Patents, Literature and Product Data
No patents are needed

#### Legal
Not Applicable

#### Political and Social Implications
bit:board promotes science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and aims to improve the understanding in the field of computer science.

#### Installation
Users are only required to replace the canvas and insert the micro:bit into the edge connector of bit:board for the operation.

#### Documentation
Documentation is made into GitHub pages for references:

http://t-tht.github.io/bitboard-docs-mkdocs/

#### Disposal
As birch plywood is used for the casing, most parts of the bit:board are recyclable. However, electrical components (e.g. batteries, touch sensors and joystick) should be separated from the bit:board before disposal to reduce impact on the environment.
