## Problem Statement:

- No existing accessory on the market suitable for learning about electronics and hardware.
- No existing accessory on the market encapsulates unnecessary details (edge connector, breakout board, breadboards) in the learning environment for ~year 7 users.
- Soldering and making connections can prove to be difficult for younger user, especially in the target user base.
- No available BLE HID Keyboard service on the Micro:bit.
- Accessories on the market does not allow user to use their creativity to form a solution.
    - Most of them add inputs that are connected to pins in the microbit using the breakout board.


## Ideas:

The term "Target Audience" below refers to our target group of students at around the age of 11 (Year 7).

#### - We want to create an environment for the target audience to learn about electronics. 
#### - Create an environment that has the right amount of complexity for the target audience 
- Not too difficult, such that the target audience will feel repulsive in the learning process
- Not too simple, such that the product will limit what the target audience can learn from it.
- Enough capacity for users to utilize and develop their creative problem solving skillsets.
    - Not everything they use is out-of-the-box, they have to create their own circuit solutions
- Enough amount of components provided to them out-of-the-box
    - joysticks, switches, dials
    - so that they don't have to create all the components
    - these off the shelves components can achieve something that drawn circuits cannot do reliably.
    - so that they will still have something to use to get a hold of how the microbit and bitboard works, during their initial stage of learning about electronics and software.
    
#### - Create a sandbox for the target audience to "get their hands dirty". Where there is a larger DIY factor.
- Learn about nature of electronic circuits
    - Digital signals (highs and lows, ones and zeroes)
    - Making connections
    - Different components ( Potentiometer, a switch )
    - Vcc and ground
- Allows for younger audiences to develop motor skills
#### - It should serve a similar purpose as MakeCode
- Their work should be able to be displayed in front of them clearly
    - Sense of achievement
    - Easy debugging
    - Easy sharing amongst fellow users
    - Ideal for teachers to oversee user's work
#### - Should also serve other purposes other than learning about programming and circuits
- Users can use this as a method for interactive story telling. (See IgIC Conductive Ink)
- Users can use this product to participate in classroom activities. (Quizzes with kahoot?)

#### - Overall, product should give a positive association with learning about electronics

    - This video demonstrates more on the DIY side that we want our product to achieve

## Concerns
- Need to tune the amount of encapsulation such that it will give a positive learning experience to the target user audience
- Need to create guides that teaches target user audience about electronics circuit and components (potentiometer)
- Need to consider the reliability of said components (pencil drawn potentiometer)
- Need to consider undefined behaviors by the user (What if they connect vcc to ground?)
