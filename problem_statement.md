Problem Statement:

- No existing accessory on the market suitable for learning about electronics and hardware.
- No existing accessory on the market encapsulates unnecessary details (edge connector, breakout board, breadboards) in the learning environment for ~year 7 users.
- Soldering and making connections can prove to be difficult for younger user, especially in the target user base.
- No available BLE HID Keyboard service on the Micro:bit.

Ideas:

- We want to create an environment for the target audience to learn about electronics. 
- Create an environment that has the right amount of complexity for the target audience 
    - Not too difficult, such that the target audience will feel repulsive in the learning process
    - Not too simple, such that the product will limit what the target audience can learn from it.
    - Enough capacity for users to utilize and develop their creative problem solving skillsets.
        - Not everything they use is out-of-the-box, they have to create their own circuit solutions
    - Enough amount of components provided to them out-of-the-box
        - joysticks, switches, dials
        - so that they don't have to create all the components
        - these off the shelves components can achieve something that drawn circuits cannot do reliably.
        - so that they will still have something to use to get a hold of how the microbit and bitboard works, during their initial stage of learning about electronics and software.
    
- Create an environment for the target audience to "get their hands dirty". Where there is a larger DIY factor.
    - Learn about nature of electronic circuits
        - Digital signals (highs and lows, ones and zeroes)
        - Making connections
        - Different components ( Potentiometer, a switch )
        - Vcc and ground
    - Allows for younger audiences to develop motor skills
- It should serve a similar purpose as MakeCode
    - Their work should be able to be displayed in front of them clearly
        - Sense of achievement
        - Easy debugging
        - Easy sharing amongst fellow users
        - 

Overall
    - Product should give a positive association with learning about electronics
