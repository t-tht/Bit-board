## Ethical Consequences

bit:board has the same aim as micro:bit - inspire children's interest in learning electronics and programming. The development of bit:board always keeps this in mind. By developing this open platform, the team hopes that it could be the place for next generation to release their creativity, facilitate their education, especially for girls.

## Sustainability consideration

This team has kept sustainability in mind from day 1. The product needs to be both environmental friendly and social-economically benificial. Electronic components and other production materials have been chosen from responsible suppliers. For example, wood has been used for the prototype instead of acrylic, which is non-degradable plastic. Bit:board has been designed to have a long lifespan - users are expected to use it from Year 7 to pre-university. This is because bit:board is a platform of creativity rather than a single-use product. Teenagers can realize projects of various difficulties on bit:board as their learning deepens. This could mean less waste both in money and in material sense. This team and micro:bit would keep developing interesting examples and tutorials to keep bit:board as a useful tool.
