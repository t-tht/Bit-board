## Ethical Consequences

bit:board has the same aim as micro:bit, which is to inspire children's interest in learning electronics and programming. The development of bit:board always keeps this in mind. By developing this open platform, the team hopes that it could be the place for future generations to release their creativity, facilitate their education, especially for girls.  

bit:board is not a cutting-edge product, but this doesn't mean the quality is low. The team continuously polished the product during the prototyping and verification stage. For instance, a lot of parameters that control the sensitivity of the touch pads and joystick have been tuned patiently, making it more user-friendly.  

Safety is another aspect that has always been taken into consideration. For example, the wooden case made had been smoothen out with sandpaper by hand especially the corners. This would minimise the chances of any injuries when using the bit:board.

## Sustainability consideration

The product needs to be both environmental friendly and social-economically beneficial. When deciding the material used for the prototype, wood was selected over acrylic, which is a non-biodegradable plastic. Electronic components and other production materials have also been purchased from suppliers approved by the university. 

bit:board has also been designed to have a lifespan of 2 years. This is possible due to the creative freedom bit:board has to offer as compared to a single-use product. Users can realise projects of various difficulties when using bit:board as their learning deepens. 

Since the bit:board is reusable and most parts are recyclable, less waste is produced. The team and micro:bit foundation would also continue to develop new and interesting examples for users in order to keep bit:board a useful and relevant tool.
