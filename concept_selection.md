## Criteria
Criteria are chosen for their relevance to the problem statement, and below explains how scores are defined for the criteria:
- Life Expectancy: how long the product is expected to last
- Target Product Cost: cost used to produce each product compared to budget given for product development
- Aesthetic: how appealing the product is to target audience
- Materials: the cost and durability of material
- Safety: how safe would the product be when in use
- Ergonomics: how the product is designed to fit the user

- Competition: how easy it is for the product to enter the market
- Disposal: environmental impact that the product brings
- Weight: weight of the product

## Selected outcome
The solution with the highest score is bit:board, which with much modification shall become the final solution. More details of the bit:board under 'Design'.
