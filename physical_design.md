# Physical Design

## Material
In order to keep the prototype as environmental-friendly as possible, the main material used to create the prototype  is **birch plywood** instead of acrylic.

## Dimensions
The ideal size of the product should be **small** enough for the user to keep it inside a **school bag**.

The file used for laser cutting and the dimensions for all the parts can be found here: [https://github.com/t-tht/bitboard-docs/blob/master/bitboard_lasercut.svg](https://github.com/t-tht/bitboard-docs/blob/master/bitboard_lasercut.svg)

Cutout | Dimension (mm x mm) | Diameter (mm)
--- | --- | ---
Touch Sensor | 16 x 6 | -
Paper Canvas Clip | 190 x 7 | -
Joystick | - | 30
LED | - | 5

## Paper Canvas
A5-sized paper is suggested to be the size of the canvas because it is easily accessible by cutting an A4 paper into halves. The paper canvas can also be replaced with a fresh new piece simply by sliding the old paper out of the cable clips then slide in the new one.

## Assembly
1. After all the panels required to build the case for the prototype were laser cut, all the panels were bound together using super glue except the cover.

2. The micro:bit breakout board was secured onto the base of the case and the stripboard was secured onto the cushion panel.

3. Each of the cable clips had a wire soldered onto it before being secured to the cover.

4. Wires from the touch sensors were passed through the small rectangular holes on the cover before sticking the sensor onto the cover. 

5. The wires from the touch sensors were then plugged into their respective headers available on the stripboard.

6. Wires soldered onto the stripboard were plugged into one of the rows of headers on the micro:bit breakout board.

7. Wires from the cable clips were also plugged into the other row of headers on the breakout board.

8. The lengths of all the wires were adjusted to ensure that the wooden case could be closed with the cover before securing it with the glue.
